Thank you for downloading my game! This is actually a school project, but I was proud of it enough to upload it.
Hope you enjoy my silly little game :]

Feel free to make your own changes :]
To rebuild:
-Delete the folder called 'build', as well as the exe file
-Click on the top part where the path is, and type 'cmd'
-Enter the following command:

pyinstaller source.py --onefile --icon=assets/misc/omori.ico --noconsole

-If you get an error that states pyinstaller doesn't exist or cannot be found, enter the following:

pip install pyinstaller

-If pip cannot be found, head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download python (3.7.9 is preferred for this game)
Make sure to add Python to PATH (you can toggle the checkbox in the install wizard)
