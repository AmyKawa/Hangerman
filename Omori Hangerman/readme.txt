Thank you for downloading my game! This is actually a school project, but I was proud of it enough to upload it.
Hope you enjoy my silly little game :]

2 Reasons why you might have to rebuild the exe file:
-Modding!! Feel free to make your own changes :]
-Your device detects that the file could have suspicious code (it doesn't, you can check source.py and go through it yourself)

To rebuild:
-Delete the folder called 'build', as well as the exe file
-Click on the top part where the path is, and type 'cmd'
1: Install pyintaller

  pip install pyinstaller

2: Create the .exe file

  pyinstaller source.py --onefile --icon=assets/misc/omori.ico --noconsole

3: Move the .exe file to the 'Omori Hangerman' folder

-If pip cannot be found, head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download python (3.7.9 is preferred for this game)
Make sure to add Python to PATH (you can toggle the checkbox in the install wizard)
